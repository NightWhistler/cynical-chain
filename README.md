NightWhistler's Completely Stupid Coin
======================================

This is a _very_ naive crypto-coin implementation, written in Scala.

It is mostly based on naivechain [https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain], but the aim is to add full cryptocurrency support.

It is mostly meant as an exercise for me to get a better grasp of how cryptocurrencies work, and at the same time test my understanding of Scala code and testing.

Once we're functionally on par with naivechain, we'll move on to naivecoin[https://github.com/conradoqg/naivecoin]
