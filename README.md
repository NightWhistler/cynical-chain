NightWhistler's Completely Stupid Coin
======================================

This is a _very_ naive crypto-coin implementation, written in Scala.

It is mostly based on naivechain [https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain], but the aim is to add full cryptocurrency support.

It is mostly meant as an exercise for me to get a better grasp of how cryptocurrencies work, and at the same time test my understanding of Scala code and testing.
